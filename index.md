# Frontend Frequencies
## A creative workshop for front-end development and reflection.

**Work in Progress:** This site is a meta-experiment documenting my journey as I learn front-end development. My goal is to create my own website from scratch and build a portfolio of creative coding projects along the way. Here, I will share:

- [Classroom notes](classroom-notes) from lessons and exercises  
- [Developer diary](transmission-log) reflecting on the process  
- [Projects and experiments](projects-experiments) built directly on this website

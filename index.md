# Frontend Frequencies

A creative workshop for front-end development and reflection.

**Work in Progress:** This site is a meta-experiment documenting my journey as I learn front-end development. My goal is to **create my own website from scratch** and build a **portfolio of creative coding projects** along the way. Here, I will share:

- My classroom notes from lessons and exercises  
- My personal developer diary reflecting on the process  
- Projects and experiments built directly on this website

## Responsive Web Design (my current class)
- [Day 1](responsive-web-design/day-1)

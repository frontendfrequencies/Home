# Switchboard
Hello, my name is Walks Tall. I have a multidisciplinary background in project management and manufacturing, and I also build websites for small businesses, personal brands, and artists.  

Frontend Frequencies is a project I launched in 2026 to document my personal growth in front-end development. It's a work in progress — rough and gritty for now — but it represents a natural next step in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.
